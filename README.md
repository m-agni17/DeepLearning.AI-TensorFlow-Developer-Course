# DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Course

This repository contains my assignments and projects for the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Course on Coursera. The course is offered by DeepLearning.AI and provides a comprehensive introduction to TensorFlow for deep learning.

## Course Description

The DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Course is designed to provide a solid foundation in TensorFlow and deep learning techniques. The course covers various topics such as neural networks, convolutional neural networks, natural language processing, sequence models, and more. It includes both theoretical explanations and hands-on coding exercises to reinforce the concepts.

## Contents

- Week 1: Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- Week 2: Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
- Week 3: Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
- Week 4: Sequences, Time Series, and Prediction

Each week consists of lecture videos, quizzes, programming assignments, and a final project.
